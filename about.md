# about

Hi! I'm Khanh Nguyen (he/they), a.k.a hardyowo, a philosophy student at the University of Edinburgh. While I am a philosophy student, I am also rather interested in mathematics. In fact, mathematics was my degree programme before I switched tracks. There are many reasons as to why I switched. To give one reason, mathematics does not address my concerns. I came into mathematics because (i) it was one of my best subjects back in high school, and (ii) I was really puzzled by proofs: why do they work and how? Mathematics does not really address the second reason why I came into it: it just assumes proofs work and goes on its merry way. Philosophy was where I should have been. And because I don't love mathematics enough to do it for its own sake, this weighed against me staying in the mathematics programme.

Besides my academic interest, you may find me aim training from time to time. You may also find me playing Valorant though that is even more on and off compared to aim training. Regarding my aim training ranks, I am [Jade Voltaic overall](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR90ShbX2dZto-6FZAVTSaXRc07-TaTszaUbE1KnM97zhPp6a4udKFx3EnVZ3ES0QPGj2y140uBu_p8/pubhtml), [Immortal Voltaic Valorant, Master 4 Season 3 Aimlabs, and Master 2 Season 4 Aimlabs](https://aimlab-stats.com/profile/hardyowo).

Another interest of mine is fashion. I find the works of Yohji Yamamoto and Rick Owens rather captivating. I must admit, I do not own any Yohji; his vision does not fit mine. That does not preclude me from enjoying him. I do own a few pieces by Rick. However, most of my wardrobe is rather tame. Check out my Instagram for some of my fit pics!
